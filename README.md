# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Introduction

The Heart Disease Prediction Project aims to create a machine-learning model that forecasts an individual's risk of heart disease based on various demographic and health characteristics. This README provides essential information to understand, run, and replicate the project.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following external libraries and frameworks:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

Ensure these dependencies are installed before running the code. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Environment Setup
Programming Language: Python
IDE: Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)
Hardware: Google Colab provides cloud-based computing resources (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs).
How to Run
Open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab.
Execute the code cells step by step.
Ensure the dataset is available, and any necessary data preprocessing steps are performed as mentioned in the code.

Results
The project's key findings include:

Significant gender-based differences in heart disease prevalence.
Association between ST segment slope and heart disease likelihood.
Correlations between specific electrocardiographic patterns and heart disease risk.
Machine learning models (Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier) were employed, with accuracy as a primary evaluation metric.

Future Work
Potential areas for improvement and expansion:
Feature engineering for enhanced predictive capacity.
Data expansion with additional relevant features or sources.
Exploration of advanced ensemble approaches like gradient boosting.
Limitations
Complexity and heterogeneity of heart diseases.
Challenges in early diagnosis and prevention.
Genetic predisposition influencing prevention strategies.
Ethical Considerations
Ensure the model's usage complies with privacy and ethical regulations.
